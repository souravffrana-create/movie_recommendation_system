# 🎬 CineMatch — Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommender that suggests similar movies based on what a movie is actually about — not just its genre.

---

## What it does

You pick a movie, it gives you 5 similar ones. That's it.

It works by combining each movie's overview, genres, keywords, cast, and director into a single tag, then using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to find the closest matches.
